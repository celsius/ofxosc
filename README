== what ? ==

this is a bunch of files directly extracted from openFrameworks' plugin ofxosc

It is distributed with the same license as openFrameworks which is distributed under the MIT License.

== why ? ==

We need openFrameworks with OSC for one of the apps distributed with MAGE (http://mage.numediart.org)

ofxosc would not compile properly inside of oF (for ubuntu 10.04 x64. OSX version is just doing fine, no need for this). Now this small cmake-based setting compiles it just fine on linux.

== How ? ==

1. have openframeworks compiled and installed (without the ofxosc plugin, that's the whole point).
2. do the standard cmake compilation stuffs:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

you can set the path to oF either with:

$ cmake .. -DOF_ROOT_PATH=/opt/openframeworks

or using ccmake

$ ccmake .

and configure inside the ccmake UI.
