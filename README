this is a bunch of files directly extracted from openFrameworks' plugin ofxosc

I couldn't manage to get it compile properly inside of oF, so I created this small cmake-based setting that compiles it just fine on linux (ubuntu 10.04 x64).

to compile:

1. have openframeworks compiled and installed (without the ofxosc plugin, that's the whole point).
2. do the standard cmake compilation stuffs:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

you can set the path to oF either with:

$ cmake .. -DOF_ROOT_PATH=/opt/openframeworks

or using ccmake

$ ccmake .

and configure it
